## 2. Architecture & Data Flow

### High-Level Architecture
```
Market Data (MT5) → Signal Generation → Risk Gates → Agent Review → Execution → Telemetry → Dashboard
```

### Data Flow Components
1. **Data Ingestion**: MT5 bars (15min timeframe, 600 bars)
2. **Signal Processing**: SMA20/50 crossover + AI ensemble (if available)
3. **Risk Assessment**: Spread, exposure, regime, conformal gates
4. **Agent Supervision**: Decision review in guard mode
5. **Order Execution**: Adaptive filling mode with fallback
6. **Monitoring**: Real-time dashboard + comprehensive logging

---

## 3. Trading Logic & Strategy

### Core Strategy: SMA Trend Following
**Primary Signal**: SMA20 vs SMA50 crossover
- **BUY Signal**: SMA20 > SMA50 (trending up)
- **SELL Signal**: SMA20 < SMA50 (trending down)
- **No Signal**: SMA20 = SMA50 (sideways)

### Signal Generation Process
```python
# Reference: live_trader_clean.py lines 1960-2030
def _generate_signal(self, df):
    # Calculate SMAs
    df['sma_20'] = df['close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
    df['sma_50'] = df['close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
    
    # Generate signal based on crossover
    if sma_20 > sma_50:
        return 1, 0.7  # BUY with 70% confidence
    elif sma_20 < sma_50:
        return -1, 0.7  # SELL with 70% confidence
    else:
        return 0, 0.0  # No signal
```

### Confidence & Scoring
- **Base Confidence**: 0.7 (70%) for all SMA signals
- **AI Enhancement**: LSTM + ML ensemble (if available)
- **Conformal Adjustment**: Dynamic threshold based on market regime
- **Final Decision**: Ensemble of base + AI signals

### Regime Detection
- **Regime Types**: TRENDING, SIDEWAYS, VOLATILE, UNKNOWN
- **Confidence Adjustment**: ±0.1 based on regime stability
- **Fallback**: Default to UNKNOWN if advanced modules unavailable

---

## 4. Risk Management

### SpreadGate (Primary Risk Control)
**Formula**: `(ask - bid) / point_value`
**Threshold**: 180 points (configurable)
**Implementation**: Blocks trades when spread > threshold

```python
# Reference: live_trader_clean.py lines 2100-2150
def check_spread_gate(self, spread_pts):
    max_spread = self.config.get('max_spread_points', 180)
    if spread_pts > max_spread:
        return False, f"Spread {spread_pts:.1f} > {max_spread}"
    return True, "Spread OK"
```

### ExposureGate (Position Management)
**Max Open Trades**: 2 positions
**Daily Loss Limit**: 2% of account balance
**Implementation**: Blocks new trades when limit reached

### Conformal Gate
**Purpose**: Adaptive confidence threshold
**Base Threshold**: 0.5 (50%)
**Dynamic Adjustment**: Based on market conditions
**Fallback**: Fixed 0.5 if conformal module unavailable

---

## 5. Execution Pipeline

### ATR-Based SL/TP Calculation
**ATR Period**: 14 bars
**SL Multiplier**: 2.0 × ATR
**TP Multiplier**: 3.0 × ATR

```python
# Reference: live_trader_clean.py lines 2430-2460
def _execute_trade(self, signal, df):
    atr = signal.get('atr')
    if signal['signal'] == 1:  # BUY
        sl = current_price - (atr * 2.0)
        tp = current_price + (atr * 3.0)
    elif signal['signal'] == -1:  # SELL
        sl = current_price + (atr * 2.0)
        tp = current_price - (atr * 3.0)
```

### Volume Normalization
**Process**: Respects broker volume constraints
**Steps**: min/max limits, volume step rounding
**Implementation**: `_normalize_volume()` function

### Adaptive Filling Mode
**Strategy**: Automatic fallback to avoid 10030 errors
**Order**: Symbol recommended → RETURN → IOC → FOK
**Success Rate**: 100% (based on recent logs)

---

## 6. Agent Supervision (Guard)

### Guard Mode Behavior
**Purpose**: Block risky trades, no auto-remediation
**Decision Points**: Every trade execution cycle
**Actions**: Review, approve/block, log decisions

### Health Event Handling
**Compatibility**: Both dict and dataclass inputs
**Event Types**: ORDER_FAIL, SYSTEM_HEALTH, PERFORMANCE
**Response**: Logging + policy evaluation (no external alerts)

---

## 7. Observability

### Logging Structure
- **Level**: INFO (configurable)
- **Format**: Timestamp + Level + Component + Message
- **Key Events**: Signal generation, risk gates, trade execution

### Dashboard Metrics
**Endpoint**: `http://127.0.0.1:8765/metrics`
**Fields**: Uptime, cycles/sec, response time, total trades, error rate, memory usage
**Update Rate**: Real-time (every cycle)

---

## 11. Executive Summary for Behzad

### What Strategy is Actually Running?
**Simple Trend Following**: The system buys when 20-period moving average crosses above 50-period MA, sells when it crosses below. It's a **momentum strategy** that follows established trends.

**Pseudo-code**:
```
IF SMA20 > SMA50 AND consecutive_signals >= 1 AND spread < 180 THEN BUY
IF SMA20 < SMA50 AND consecutive_signals >= 1 AND spread < 180 THEN SELL
```

### When Does It Trade?
**Execution Conditions** (ALL must be met):
1. ✅ Signal generated (SMA crossover)
2. ✅ Consecutive signals ≥ 1 (configurable)
3. ✅ Spread < 180 points
4. ✅ Open positions < 2
5. ✅ Daily loss < 2%
6. ✅ Agent approval (guard mode)

**Blocking Conditions**:
- High spread (>180 points)
- Max positions reached (2)
- Daily loss limit exceeded
- Agent blocks risky decision

### Why Does It Sometimes Block?
1. **Spread Too High**: Market volatility or off-hours trading
2. **Position Limit**: Already have 2 open trades
3. **Risk Threshold**: Daily loss approaching 2%
4. **Agent Guard**: Blocks trades below confidence threshold

### Top-5 Strengths
1. **Adaptive Filling Mode**: Automatically handles broker compatibility (10030 errors solved)
2. **Comprehensive Risk Management**: Multiple layers of protection
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Dashboard + detailed logging
4. **Agent Supervision**: AI-powered decision review
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and recovery

### Top-5 Weaknesses
1. **Fixed Confidence**: Always 70% regardless of market conditions
2. **Limited AI Integration**: ML ensemble not fully utilized
3. **No Market Session Awareness**: Trades during low-liquidity periods
4. **Fixed Risk Parameters**: No dynamic adjustment based on volatility
5. **Single Symbol Focus**: No portfolio diversification

### 3 Quick Wins for Immediate Improvement
1. **Dynamic Confidence**: Adjust confidence based on ATR volatility (0.5-0.9 range)
2. **Session Awareness**: Block trades during low-liquidity hours
3. **Position Sizing**: Use ATR-based volume calculation for better risk management
