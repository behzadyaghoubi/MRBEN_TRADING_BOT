### Take Profit Calculation Logic

The system uses the following logic in `_calculate_atr_based_sl_tp()`:

```python
def _calculate_atr_based_sl_tp(self, df: pd.DataFrame, entry_price: float, signal: int) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    try:
        atr = float(df['atr'].iloc[-1])
        sl_dist = atr * 2.0  # Stop Loss: 2x ATR
        tp_dist = atr * 4.0  # Take Profit: 4x ATR
        if signal == 1:  # BUY
            return entry_price - sl_dist, entry_price + tp_dist
        else:  # SELL
            return entry_price + sl_dist, entry_price - tp_dist
    except Exception:
        # conservative fallback
        if signal == 1:
            return entry_price - 0.5, entry_price + 1.0
        else:
            return entry_price + 0.5, entry_price - 1.0
```

### Key Features Working

1. âœ… **ATR-based calculation**: Take profit is calculated as 4x ATR distance
2. âœ… **Proper direction**: For SELL orders, TP is below entry price
3. âœ… **Minimum distance enforcement**: TP respects broker minimum distance requirements
4. âœ… **Price rounding**: TP is properly rounded to broker specifications
5. âœ… **MT5 integration**: TP is correctly sent to MT5 platform
6. âœ… **Trade logging**: TP is properly recorded in trade logs

### Trailing Stop Behavior

The trailing stop functionality correctly:
- âœ… Only modifies the stop loss (SL)
- âœ… Leaves the take profit (TP) unchanged
- âœ… Updates SL based on price movement and ATR

### Recent Log Evidence

From the live trader logs:
```
[2025-08-07 18:13:34,836][INFO] ðŸ“¤ Sending SELL: price=3386.58 sl=3405.16 tp=3349.42 vol=0.1
[2025-08-07 18:13:34,906][INFO] âœ… EXECUTED #1730517
```

This shows that the take profit (3349.42) is being properly calculated and sent to MT5.

## Conclusion

**The take profit functionality is working correctly.** Both stop loss and take profit are being:
- Calculated based on ATR (2x for SL, 4x for TP)
- Properly enforced with minimum distance requirements
- Correctly sent to MT5 platform
- Accurately logged in trade records

No fixes are needed for the take profit functionality.
