# STEP4: ML Filter (ONNX) - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented ML Filter and LSTM Direction models for the MR BEN trading system.

## Components Implemented

### 1. ML Filter (RandomForest) ✅
- **Model Type**: RandomForest Classifier
- **Format**: ONNX (.onnx)
- **Location**: `models/ml_filter_v1.onnx`
- **Features**: 17-dimensional feature vectors
- **Purpose**: Signal noise reduction and filtering

### 2. LSTM Direction Model ✅
- **Model Type**: Mock LSTM (rule-based simulation)
- **Format**: Joblib (.joblib)
- **Location**: `models/lstm_dir_v1.joblib`
- **Features**: 50 timesteps × 17 features
- **Purpose**: Direction prediction with sequence data

### 3. Decision Engine Integration ✅
- **MLFilter Class**: Handles ONNX model inference
- **LSTMDir Class**: Handles both ONNX and joblib models
- **Decider Class**: Combines all signals with dynamic confidence
- **Ensemble Voting**: Rule-based (50%) + Price Action (20%) + ML (20%) + LSTM (10%)

### 4. Feature Engineering ✅
- **ML Features**: `build_features()` - 17 dimensions
- **LSTM Features**: `prepare_lstm_features()` - [T, F] format
- **Price Action**: Pattern detection (engulf, pin, inside, sweep)

## Technical Details

### ML Filter
- Uses ONNX Runtime for inference
- Handles RandomForest output format correctly
- Returns direction (+1/-1) and confidence (0.0-1.0)

### LSTM Model
- Mock implementation for development/testing
- Simulates momentum-based direction prediction
- Compatible with both ONNX and joblib formats
- Ready for replacement with actual trained LSTM

### Decision Flow
1. Rule-based signal validation
2. Price action pattern scoring
3. ML filter confidence check
4. LSTM direction agreement
5. Dynamic confidence calculation
6. Ensemble voting and threshold check
