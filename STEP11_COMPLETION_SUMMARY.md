  "risk_threshold": 0.8,
  "confidence_threshold": 0.7,
  "monitoring_interval": 10.0,
  "max_interventions_per_hour": 10,
  "max_warnings_per_hour": 20,

### Risk Scoring Algorithm
```python
def _calculate_risk_score(self, decision: DecisionCard, context: MarketContext) -> float:
    risk_score = 0.0
    
    # Base risk from decision confidence
    risk_score += (1.0 - decision.confidence) * 0.3
    
    # Risk from market regime
    if context.regime == "high":
        risk_score += 0.2
    elif context.regime == "low":
        risk_score += 0.1
    
    # Risk from session
    if context.session == "overlap":
        risk_score += 0.1
    
    # Risk from position size
    if decision.lot > 1.0:
        risk_score += 0.1
    
    return min(risk_score, 1.0)
```

### Intervention Types
